#Playground


A Redpanda cluster with one broker has already installed for you on this single node Kubernetes environment.
![Redpanda Playground Overview](./images/overview.png)

Tools available in the playground:

- Helm: This helps you define, install, and upgrade applications running on Kubernetes.
- `kubectl`: The Kubernetes command-line tool lets you deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs in Kubernetes cluster. 
- `rpk`: The Redpanda command-line tool lets you manage your entire Redpanda cluster, without the need to run a separate script for each function, as with Apache Kafka. The `rpk` commands handle everything from configuring nodes and low-level tuning to high-level general Redpanda tasks.
