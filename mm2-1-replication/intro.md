Welcome to the lab, where you will get hands-on experience with migrating data from an Apache Kafka cluster to a Redpanda cluster using MirrorMaker 2.0 (MM2). Redpanda is a Kafka-compatible streaming data platform that is less complex and less costly than any other commercial mission-critical event streaming platform. As industries are continuously looking to optimize their data processing infrastructure, having the ability to smoothly transition between systems is crucial. In this lab, we will walk through the process step-by-step, ensuring you have a firm grasp on how this migration works.


Switching to Redpanda from other Kafka platforms is easy and involves a few simple steps.
