In this tutorial, you'll use Flink's highest level API, Flink SQL, to build your greetings application. __Flink SQL__ allows you to express complex stream and batch processing logic using a concise and familiar language.

By using SQL to create your Flink jobs, you can:

- focus on the business logic
- enjoy a smoother learner curve
- minimize the complexity of your application

The first step to building the application is to start the Flink SQL client. You'll use this client to submit your jobs to the Flink cluster.

To start the client, run the following command:

```
docker-compose run sql-client
```{{exec interrupt}}
