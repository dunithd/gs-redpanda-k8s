A couple of notes before we get started.

1. Please note that this course was created for illustrative purposes only, and we are not recommending any specific trading strategies, stocks, or cryptocurrencies.

2. In order to pull the data from Alpaca, you'll need an API key. We didn't want to make that a requirement for this tutorial, so we have pre-downloaded some data for you.

    Use this exercise to get your feet wet with Redpanda, Flink, and stock data. If you decide you want to pull the historical and live data from Alpaca using an API key, and issue trades in a live paper-trading environment, visit our <a href="https://university.redpanda.com/courses/use-cases-algorithmic-trading" target="_blank">full tutorial at Redpanda University</a> or view <a  href="https://github.com/redpanda-data-university/rp-use-cases-algo-trading/tree/main/02-data-collection/examples/alpaca" target="_blank">the data collection scripts</a> in the source repository.

With that out of the way, let's get started.
